# AirBnb-pricing
Problem statement: Building a model to predict the prices of AirBnBs in European cities which are popular among tourists. I want to explore how the prices of accommodation differ in different regions in Europe and what factors impact the price.

The dataset being used: https://zenodo.org/record/4446043#.ZAlnNXbMK5d

This dataset offers a thorough view of Airbnb rates in some of the most well-known European cities. Each listing is assessed according to a number of factors, including the number of bedrooms, room kinds, cleanliness and satisfaction ratings, and how far it is from the city center, in order to gain a thorough grasp of Airbnb rates both during the week and on the weekends.
